# Systematic Program Design

## 1 - 3
In folders 1 - 3, the `starter` files were worked on and updated according to the course content or given exercise.
The `.rkt~` files were automatic backups of the initial version, created by Dr. Racket.
The `solution` files include the example solution.
Files ending in `yo` indicate own answers to problems or exercises without a starter file.

Note that these conventions were not strictly followed throughout the first three chapters.
