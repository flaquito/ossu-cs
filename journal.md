# Systematic Program Design

My solution matches the given one very closely for the movie problem. Of note: the given solution uses existing data examples for its examples (`check-expect`), which I avoided since it's not possible when designing *only* the function—but I guess designing a function for movies without its data definition doesn't make much sense. My naming is alright. I see that I could have used a simple `if` instead of a `cond` expression—remember fundamentals!
