## Journaling

On 01.07.2025, while working on section 3b of the first course, Systematic program design, I decided to include a journal and document some observations about my progress or my work every day. We'll see where it leads; this is very much an experiment for now (01.07.2025).

## Contribute

This is intended to document my working through the OSSU CS course and hence not for collaboration.
